# wordplay
A simple c++ project which uses basis file I/O and generate a random English word along with its meaning. I submitted this is as my freshmen year final project. 

Report file containt the working demo of the project. Read it once to get familiar with the project.

test.cpp contains the main source code.

example_2.txt contanis the english words along with numbering. I used to python to format it in the manner that I needed for my project to work. This can be a useful resource and someone else might use it to create something else.

collection.txt contains the word you choose to add to your collection to read in future. You have the functionality to add more words to it currently I might have some words already added to it.
